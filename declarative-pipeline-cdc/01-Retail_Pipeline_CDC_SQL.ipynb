    "Change Data Capture (CDC) is the process that captures the changes in records made to transactional Database (Mysql, Postgre) or Data Warehouse. CDC captures operations like data deletion, append and updating, typically as a stream to re-materialize the table in external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "CDC enables incremental loading while eliminating the need for bulk load updating.\n",
    "\n",
    "By capturing CDC events, we can re-materialize the source table as Delta Table in our Lakehouse and start running Analysis on top of it (Data Science, BI), merging the data with external system.\n",
